JSON Parsing Library for Processing
===================================

This is a JSON parsing library for Processing designed to parse directly from a source stream (versus reading the JSON
into memory as a String, then parsing), and representing it in the fields of declared classes. This makes it
more convenient to access the data than with the generic JSONObject interface.
